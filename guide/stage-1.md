## Stage 1 - Python Basics 

Welcome to the World of Tomorrow! 

Well, it's my first time writing Python as well. Don't you worry! 

So, first things first!

### Hello World

```
println("Hello World")
println("Goodbye Cruel World")
```

Try to get this to print in your Terminal, I am using Microsoft Visual Code as my IDE.


### If Statement

Tale as old as time, you'll need to assign variables to be true or false. So, it will display the messages respectively.

```
is_happy = True

if is_happy == True :
    print("Hello World")
else:
    print("Goodbye Cruel World")
```
