# Stage 2 - Thought Process

Alright, you've been through the basics of Python fundamentals.
Now, what?

So, Snake and Ladders right. So, here are some questions that you should ask yourself.

1) What's the most important thing standing between a user and a program?
2) How would user interact with your game?
3) And, most important of all where the bloody hell is the **START** button?

> That would be what we call an user interface.

You need something for user type and give command to your program, so that your program would know what the user wants to do. 
It can be a click on a button, can be your voice command, but for this exercise purpose since it's a text based game.

Let's build an user interface that user can interact with.

## Chapter 1 - User Interface

### Question

1) What can the user type?
2) What can the user do, after they type?
3) How can I process what the user type and give them what they expect me to do?
