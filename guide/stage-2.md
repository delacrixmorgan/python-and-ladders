## Stage 2 - Snake and Ladders

Introduction

A developer has to know how to program! Not just with m4d ski11z, but responsibly
and sustainably. We work in teams, on projects spanning weeks and months. Therefore,
approaches to solving a problem have to be weighed for flexibility, suitability
and understandability.

We adopt only the best standards in our writing of code. To us, it‚Äôs more than
just getting the job done. We are proud of our work and we hope to impart that
on you in the course of a potential opportunity to work together.

Best Practices

Some practices that should be common to all coders:
* Proper, meaningful, and consistent naming conventions - especially if you
  intend to still be able to understand your own code months down the road.
  Also keep note of punctuation, casing, spacing, and grammar.

* Simple, uncomplicated code - let‚Äôs not do this the hard way (code is for
  solving problems, not for showing how clever you are).

* Useful comments - they‚Äôre not just fillers.

* Proper indentation - don‚Äôt underestimate the horror of bad spacing.

Task: Snakes & Ladders Game

Now, to the fun part. Write a simple Snakes & Ladders game simulation below.
Don't worry about the fancy graphics, this is just a game simulation. All you
need to do is to print out the output of each dice roll until one of the
players reach position 100.

Here's an example of what your output should look like:

```
Round [1]: Blue player rolled 6, moved from position 1 to position 6
Round [2]: Red player rolled 3, moved from position 1 to position 3
Round [3]: Blue player rolled 8, moved from position 6 to position 13
Round [3]: Blue player found a ladder on position 13 to position 24
Round [3]: Blue player is now at position 24
Round [4]: Red player rolled 2, moved from position 3 to position 5
```
Round [29]: Blue player rolled 3, moved from position 97 to position 100
Winning condition met!
Game finished in 29 rounds with Blue player as winner


Your code should minimally meet the following criteria:

* Your code should have at least 2 classes (to demonstrate your understanding
  of Object-oriented Programming).
* Your code has to be compilable.

*Bonus* points if you finish within 30 minutes.
